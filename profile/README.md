There are many programming libraries out there, and here is my own. The utilties here are written to be:
* **Performant:** Whatever approach is taken, whether naive or complex the overall result should be fast.
* **Scalable:** The algorithms and processes chosen are ideally linear or sublinear where possible.
* **Memory Conscious:** Functions don't allocate if they don't need to.
* **Exceptionless:** Functions don't throw exceptions if they don't need to.
